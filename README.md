# Slides for "A gentle introduction to formal verification of Ethereum smart contracts"

## Abstract
This lecture provides a structured introduction to the verification of
Ethereum smart contracts, beginning with the fundamentals of the Ethereum
execution layer and progressing all the way to verification. The session
consists of two parts: (1) Theoretical background:  EVM execution semantics,
bytecode analysis, the Solidity language, fuzzing and verification systems for
the EVM. (2) Hands-on tutorial in which we will write, compile and examine a
few contracts, verifying some of their properties. Overall, the goal of the
two-part lecture is to gain both conceptual knowledge of the EVM, and hands-on
experience with it and its associated tooling for building, examining, and
verifying smart contracts.

## Contents
Meant to be a hands-on lecture for Phd/Postdoc students, but also suitable for
advanced undergraduates. The lecture contains slides from the [hevm
presentation](https://github.com/msooseth/hevm-presentation) given at various
conferences, but gives a much more comprehensive introduction to the
Ethereum execution layer and related tools and issues.

## Presented at
Brussels, Belgium, 9th of July 2025, at the 4th Summer School on Security
Testing and Verification
